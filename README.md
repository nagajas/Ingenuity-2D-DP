# Ingenuity-2D-DP

This repository contains code files and resources related to 2D Dynamic Programming workshop conducted by Ingenuity at IIT Bhilai.

## Problems Discussed
1. ### [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

    Starting from the top-left corner of an `m x n` grid, how many unique paths are there to the bottom-right corner if you can only move either down or right at any point in time?

    ### Solutions:
    1. C++
        - [Tabulation](./1.%20Unique%20Paths/bottom_up.cpp)
        - [Combinatorics](./1%20Unique%20Paths/math.cpp)
    2. Python
        - [Tabulation](./1.%20Unique%20Paths/bottom_up.py)
        - [Tabulation with Space Optimization](./1.%20Unique%20Paths/bottom_up_space.py)
        - [Combinatorics](./1.%20Unique%20Paths/math_sol.py)

2. ### [Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)

    Same as the previous problem, but now there are obstacles in the grid. You cannot move through obstacles.

    ### Solutions:
    1. C++
        - [Tabulation](./2.%20Unique%20Paths%20with%20Obstacles/bottom_up.cpp)
    2. Python
        - [Tabulation](./2.%20Unique%20Paths%20with%20Obstacles/bottom_up.py)


3. ### [Book Shop](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1158)

    You are in a book shop which sells `n` books, and you have `x` coins. Given the prices and pages of each book, find the maximum number of pages you can buy with the given amount of coins. 

    ### Solutions:
    1. C++
        - [Tabulation](./3.%20Book%20Shop/bottom_up.cpp)
        - [Tabulation with Space Optimization](./3.%20Book%20Shop/bottom_up_space.cpp)
    2. Python
        - [Tabulation with Space Optimization](./3.%20Book%20Shop/bottom_up_space.py)
